// Stability is Sorting Algorithm

/**
 * --> Stability in Sorting Algorithm:
 * o If the array of objects is given and we need to sort them, then after sorting 
 * if the natural order is preserved then we say that sorting algorithm is stable.
 * 
 * o Example:
 *      arr[] = [("Anil", 50), ("Ayan", 80), ("Piyush", 50), ("Ramesh", 80)]
 * 
 *      After stable sorting:
 *      [("Anil", 50), ("Piyush", 50), ("Ayan", 80), ("Ramesh", 80)]
 * 
 *      After unstable sorting:
 *      [("Piyush", 50), ("Anil", 50), ("Ayan", 80), ("Ramesh", 80)] --> in the original order piyush is after anil
 * 
 * o Stable Sorting Algorithm: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort
 * o Unstable sorting algorithm: Selection sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
