// Merge Sort Introduction

/**
 * 1. Divide and Conquer Algorithm --> (Divide, Conquer and Merge)
 * 2. Stable Algorithm
 * 3. Theta(n log n) Time and O(n) aux space.
 * 4. Well suited for linked lists. Works in O(1) aux space.
 * 5. Used in External Sorting.
 * 6. In general for arrays, quicksort outperforms.
