// Applications of Linked List

/**
 * 1. Worst case insertion at the end and begin are Theta(1).
 * 2. Worst case deletion from the beginning is theta(1).
 * 3. Insertion and deletions in the middle are theta(1) if we have reference to the previous node.
 * 4. Round Robin implementation.
 * 5. Merging two sorted linked lists is faster than arrays.
 * 6. Implementation of simple memory manager where we need to link free blocks.
 * 7. Easier implementation of queue and deque data structures.
