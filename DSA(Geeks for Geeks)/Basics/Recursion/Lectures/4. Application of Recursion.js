// Application of Recursion
/**
 * 1. Many algorithm techniques are based on Recursion
 *  --> Dynamic Programming
 *  --> Backtracking
 *  --> Divide and conquer (Binary Search, Quick sort and merge sort)
 * 
 * 2. Many problems inherently recursive
 *  --> Tower of Hanoi
 *  --> DFS based traversals (DFS of Graph and Inorder/Preorder/Postorder traversel of tree)
 *  example fo dfs is searching file in various sub folders
