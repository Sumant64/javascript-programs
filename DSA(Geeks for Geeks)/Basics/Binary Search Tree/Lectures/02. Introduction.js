/**
 * 1. For every node, keys in left side are smaller and keys in right side are greater.
 *                        50
 *                  30         70
 *              10     40    60   80
 * 2. All keys are typically considered as distant.
 * 3. Like linked list, it is a linked data structures.
 * 4. Implemented in C++ as map, set, multimap and multiset. And in Java
