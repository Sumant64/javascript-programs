// Rope Cutting Problem --> there are given total sum of rope, and 3 pieces of rope.
// We need to find the maximum pieces used to make the total sum of rope.

/**
 * I/P: n = 5, a = 2, b = 5, c = 1
 * O/P: 5 --> c = 1 X 5 = 5
 * -------------------------------------
 * 
 * I/P: n = 23, a = 12, b = 9, c = 11
 * O/P: 2
 * We make 2 pieces of lengths 11 and 12
